# Standard Operational Procedure: Brew Monk

This is a step-by-step instruction on how to brew beer using the Brew Monk, last updated 05.11.20. 

## Phase 0: Preparation
1: Install the bazooka filter in the bottom of the Monk
2: Rinse the Monk, then fill it with the desired amount of water. It should say in the Sheet file on the Drive. If not, the rule is 3 L of water per kg of malt
3: Assemble the insert which goes into the malt barrel. Some important details we learned:
The bottom filter MUST be installed in the opposite way to what the manual says. I.e., it should look til |_---_|, not |-__-|. If this is not done, the malt will fall through to the heating plate and you’re fucked
The top of the insert rod can have either a plastic cork or not. It should have the cork when adding the malt, but it should be open after that so that if there is a buildup of wort in the malt barrel, the excess wort can run down the centre of the hollow rod

## Phase 1: Mashing
1: Once the water has reached the desired temperature, dump in the malt and stir it. Once you think everything is wet, place the top filter plate and start the pump
2: When there is approximately 25 minutes left of the mash, start boiling and collecting water for sparging in a spare fermentation vessel. The amount of water should be listed in the Sheet. Use both the water boiler in our room and the one in the Nano room. I have not tested if the circuit can handle both boilers running in our room
3: Once the mashing is done, do a “mash-out”, i.e. increase the temperature to 77 Celcius and leave it there for 10 minutes.

## Phase 2: Sparging
1: Raise the malt barrel using the insertable handle and leave it to drain
2: While the malt is draining, set the Monk to “boiling”. Note that this is one step beyond 100 Celsius on the display
3: Adjust the temperature of the sparging water to 75-78 Celsius
4: Add the sparging water in 3-4 batches. Note that the temperature of the water tends to drop between the batches of sparge water and may need to be adjusted with more boiled water
5: Once you are done, throw away the malt or keep some for knekkebrød

## Phase 3: Boiling
1: With the lid off, boil for the time specified in the Sheet. BEWARE: The wort will tend to foam a lot in the early stages and can boil over if you’re not careful
2: Add hops and other ingredients as directed on the Sheet. Use the hop bag!
3: When there is 10 minutes of boiling left, add the cooling spiral to the Monk to sanitize it. Beware of hot water spurting from the openings!

## Phase 4: Cooling
1: Turn on the cooling water and wait for the temperature to drop. Check the yeast for temperature, but you generally want to go below 20 C. If the pump is clogged, you can move the spiral around to help speed up the cooling process. This is a good idea to do even if the pump is clogged
2: While the wort is cooling, rinse and sanitize a fermentation vessel. Use 5 L of water and 0.5 OZ of Star San as per the packaging on the Star San container
3: Spray sanitizing solution up the tap of the Monk
4: When the wort is cool, open the tap (remember the lock!) and let the wort drop into the vessel. If it flows slowly, clean and sanitize the ladle and your hands and rub the bazooka filter
5: Remember to take a gravity sample from the tap 

## Phase 5: Aeration and yeast addition
**KEEP EVERYTHING SANITIZED FROM THIS POINT**
1: Spray sanitizer on the scissors and the yeast packet(s)
2: Add yeast to wort
3: Spray sanitizer on your finger and plug the hole in the lid
4: Shake/agitate vigorously for at least one minute to aerate thoroughly
5: Add the airlock and fill it with sanitizing solution
6: Clean up and go home!
